### Metodology

The master's degree contemplates 50% distance learning and the theory classes (Groups 1) are always face-to-face (in the classroom or online via Google Meet). The planning consists of the cyclical alternation of weeks (of type A, B or C) with different distribution patterns of classes of theory groups (Groups 1) and practices (Groups PA101). The order of the sequence of the different types of weeks C, A, B, C, A, B, ‚Ä¶
* Type A week: Monday from 5:00 p.m. to 5:50 p.m. Group 1 (Theory). [Online][meet]
* Week type B:
  * Monday from 5:00 p.m. to 5:50 p.m. Group 1. [Online][meet]
  * Wednesday:
      * from 16 to 16:50. PA101 group. Room 1.3
      * from 5 to 5:50 p.m. PA101 group. room 1.3
      * from 18 to 18:50. PA101 group. room 1.3
      
      Taking into account the duration of 50 minutes, we can compact the three in a schedule from 4 to 5:30 p.m.
